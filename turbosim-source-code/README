Short description:

Turbosim takes a model to simulate in a compiled form loaded into it's
internal RAMs. Then a set of events (stimuli) are loaded into
turbosim that forces the simulated design. 
When Turbosim is signaled to start working it applies all input 
events to the simulated model. Every calculated event will be 
spit out from trubosim and collected by the test bench.

IMPORTANT FILES:
sim_project.v : The top file it implement the test bench and instantiate the 
	      	turbosim module

turbosim.v : The simulator itself

in order to run the project using Modelsim, one should
run ModelSim cd into project's dir and type in its terminal:
> vlib work
> do run_sim_project

In any other simulator one should compile all verilog source files in 
all dirs then run the simulation when top file is sim_project.v.
As reference use run_sim_project file.
